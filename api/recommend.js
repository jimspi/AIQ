  const prompt = `A user has just completed an AI skill self-assessment and paid for a personalized learning plan. Their profile is:

- AI Score: ${score}
- Tier: ${tier}
- Tools Used: ${tools.join(', ') || 'None'}
- Project Summary: ${projects || 'None'}

Based on this, create a friendly, high-value, practical 3-part learning and action plan they can use this week. Tailor it to their skill level (${tier}). Use everyday language, and donâ€™t overwhelm them with technical jargon. Avoid code-heavy tasks.

Your response must include:
1. A real-world concept or application of AI that fits their score and experience. Explain what it means and why it matters for everyday life or work.
2. A no-code project idea they can try this week using a free tool, or another level appropriate-friendly option. Be specific â€” walk them through what to do step-by-step.
3. A new tool, tip, or strategy they likely havenâ€™t used yet â€” something powerful but simple, with an example of how to start using it today.

Make it feel like expert coaching â€” practical, encouraging, and worth the $25 they paid. Donâ€™t overwhelm. Instead, spark confidence and momentum. Add a warm closing line like a coach would say. Keep it under 600 tokens.`;
